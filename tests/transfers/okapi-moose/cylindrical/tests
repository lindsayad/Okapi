  # fuel pin coupling of OpenMC and MOOSE, pin temperature is expanded in
  # a Zernike-Legendre expansion, but due to limitations in OpenMC at the time,
  # only the zero-th order FE coefficient is passed to OpenMC (i.e. a constant
  # value). At the time of creation, OpenMC only had Zernike FEs, so a 5-th
  # order Zernike FE is used to pass the fission distribution to MOOSE (no
  # axial dependence).
